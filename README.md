These options can be configured in your
[vimrc script][vimrc] by including a line like this:

Note that after changing an option in your [vimrc script] [vimrc] you have to
restart Vim for the changes to take effect.

###The `g:predictive#disable_plugin` option

Default = 0 (enabled)

    let g:predictive#disable_plugin = 1


###The `g.predictive#dict_path` option

Specify the path file for the dictionary.
Default = ''

    let g:predictive#dict_path = expand($HOME . '/dict')

View {dict_sample} directory for saples. The file must be file read/write
permissions

###The `completefunc` option

Set lines below in your _vimrc for automatic prediction:

    let &completefunc='predictive#complete'
    let g:acp_behaviorUserDefinedFunction = 'predictive#complete'
    let g:acp_behaviorUserDefinedMeets = 'predictive#meets_for_predictive'
